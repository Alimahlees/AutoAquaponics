# Prototype for logging sensor data
### This code has the following data logging functionality so far
1. Print voltage of pH and temperature sensor every second
2. Display a graph of pH and temperature sensor voltage every 5 sec
3. Save the graphed pH and temperature sensor data into test2.csv

GUI is the graphical interface that's supposed to eventually display everything with live graphs and buttons to toggle on/off relay controls and allow user to adjust relay timers.
